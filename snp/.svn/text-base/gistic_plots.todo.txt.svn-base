gistic_plots to do
==================
- leave gistic_plots.m and plot_snp_score as compatibility layers
- factor out code for a single plot from plot_snp_score (eliminate 'k')
    - optional parameters in struct w/defaults
    - better significance line independent of scale ticks
        - line extends over scale
        - green digits
    - unrotate main graph so that linkaxes can be used
    - move tick generation
