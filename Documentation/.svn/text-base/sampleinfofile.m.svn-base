% Sample Info File
% 
% The sample info file is a tab-delimited text file (*.txt) containing sample
% information about arrays included in gistic preprocessing.  .xls read
% is also currently supported.  The required columns of the sample
% information file are:
% 
% 	    'array' -- Must be uniq and must match array name given in
% 	    array list file and .sdesc of data structure.
% 
% 	    'name' -- sample name (does not need to be unique).
% 
% 	    'ploidy' -- column must be included and '2's must be entered
% 	    for normal samples
% 
% 	    'gender' -- enter 'F' for female samples.
% 
% 	    'batch' -- enter the batch name
% 
% 	    'type' -- enter  'Control' for control samples
% 
% 	    'uniqid' -- A uniqid name to identify the same sample run
% 	    on different platforms.  (e.g. hind and xba arrays from
% 	    the same sample would each have the same uniqid)  The
% 	    uniqid is used in merge platforms.
% 
% The fields above must be included in the sample information file.
% However, additional fields are allowed.  (Read_sample_info_file reads
% all fields from the sample info file into the .sis field of the data
% structure.)
% 	    
% See also 'read_sample_info_file.m' and 'add_sample_info.m'.
